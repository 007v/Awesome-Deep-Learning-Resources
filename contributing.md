# Contribution Guidelines

This projects conforms to a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. Also, it is released under a [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/awesome-deep-learning-resources/blob/master/LICENSE), which dedicates this project to the world-wide public domain and ensure this work has the widest reach.

Specifically, the actual repository and the ones I link to are about learning resources related to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Maths, Data Science, and related Computer Science subjects. To contribute about other subjects, please visit the global [Curated list of awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

## Two ways to contribute

I consider [my list](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/awesome-deep-learning-resources) as mine (personalized) while shared to the public. That way, I will accept two types of contributions:
- Personalized contributions that are direct links to useful learning resources. I only post to [my list](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/awesome-deep-learning-resources) content that I have carefully reviewed and liked. If you want to have my approval to contribute directly to it rather than to a fork of it, I will first need to read your content, and to consider it helpful enough or interesting enough within the scope of my work, interests and knowledge.
- Links to other lists: those links are not necessarily links I have reviewed in depth. If you want to have your own list, read the section (directly below) on [How to make your own personal or general awesome list (and make me add a link to it)](#fork). This way, rather than incorporating links directly in my list and on my behalf, I will point to your own awesome list that is managed by you.

## How to make your own personal or general awesome list based on this one (and to have me link to it)

Steps:

- [Fork](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/awesome-deep-learning-resources/network/members) my repository for this list (with the fork button at the top right corner) to make a "branched-off" copy of it to your GitHub account. _Note that there are already some forks of my personal repository right now, but they do not respect the current `contributing.md` guidelines because I added those guidelines recently._
  - To make your fork of my list general rather than personal, remove my name which is found in the first paragraph of the [README.md](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/awesome-deep-learning-resources/blob/master/README.md). Be sure to edit that in your own fork rather than opening a pull request in my repository.
  - You might else want to put your name (rather than no name) to make your fork yours. If you do that, ensure to review every link in your forked list to make them point to YOUR favorite content rather than mine.
- If you want to personalize how people can contribute to your list, edit your copy of `contributing.md`. In case your repository is not following the "personal" template, you might want to strip out the [Two ways to contribute](#two-ways) section and other details.
- I am willing to link to your fork from my own personalized repository. The link to forks will be placed within the [Contributing section of my README.md](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/awesome-deep-learning-resources/blob/master/README.md#contributing).
- For this, you must respect the [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)). I will accept your pull request if you did things in a clean way: I recommend reading the [general guide on contributing to awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md). _Note: Especially here, pull requests might be harder to open by yourself because that you edited your forked list yourself in plus of wanting to edit my list to add yours to it. You might use a new branch in your fork from the point in time when you have just-forked-my-repository to be able to open the pull request in a way to only add the link to your list's repository. Else, you could as well open an issue on my repository by giving me the link to your fork: stating that you have read the `contributing.md` and that you want me to point to your list's link, which you will have provided._

Hint: You may also want to post your fork to [other awesome lists](#other-lists). Before doing so, if I remember well enough, it is recommended that you at least get a few stars on your list and that you wait some time (e.g.: 1 month), for that your repository has at least some popularity. My repository has a "personal" template that can also be converted to a general one. If you prefer creating a repository from scratch rather than a fork of my repository - and that you want me to link to it - I will also require that you first link to my repository within yours in plus respecting the [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
